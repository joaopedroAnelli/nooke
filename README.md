# 🪶 Nooke — Shopify Hydrogen Portfolio Storefront

Nooke is a **custom Shopify storefront** built with [Shopify Hydrogen](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen) and [Remix](https://remix.run/).
It serves as a **portfolio project** to showcase my expertise in modern e-commerce development using Shopify’s headless stack.

This project demonstrates how to build a performant, design-focused storefront leveraging my **7+ years of experience with React.js**, while integrating the latest Hydrogen features to create a seamless, dynamic shopping experience.
